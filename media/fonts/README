The only fonts that remain in this directory are those that are used by the Demo
Studio and the Dev Derby. We have not updated the styles of those sites to use
new fonts because the sites might be removed or completely redesigned soon.

All other fonts actively used on MDN are in media/redesign/fonts.

The font Milk is a special case. It is actively used in the redesign, but is
also used by the Demo Studio. For this reason, the files for Milk live in
media/redesign/fonts but are also symlinked from this directory. This allows us
to blow away this directory when the Demo Studio and Dev Derby are updated
without affecting other usage of Milk in the redesign. (We could alternatively
update the @font-face rule in demos.css to point to the permanent copies in
media/redesign/fonts, but the symlinks also allow us to see, in one place, all
of the fonts used by the Demo Studio and Dev Derby.)
